            <h2>What Is Herbal Medicine?</h2>
            <ul id="main">
              <li>Herbal Medicine is the use of plants to heal our body, mind and spirit. There are several types of herbal medicine used by a herbalist including herbal teas, tinctures, creams and essences. Teas, tinctures and creams help our physical body to heal and relax the mind. Plant Essences work with our emotions and consciousness to help us grow and expand.</li>

              <li>There is a lot more to healing than is currently practised in our healthcare system. Real healing goes way beyond the physical. By using plants to heal us we can begin to understand the power of the mind and our role in healing our own bodies and lives.</li>

              <li>Plant medicines work in an entirely different way than orthodox medicines, they are alive and contain intelligent life-force or spirit that teach us to heal our minds and bodies through direct realisation of how we have created our disease and how we can heal it. This may seem a burden at first but with understanding we realise that we are empowered by this knowledge and as nature teaches us to regain control of our health and our lives, we see that we can create anything we want in our life. Ultimately this power is our birthright.</li>
